# CodeClan Data Course Laptop Setup

A script to set up a macOS laptop for development.

## Requirements

We support:

* macOS Sierra (10.12)
* macOS High Sierra (10.13)

Older versions may work but aren't tested.

## Install

Download and review the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeclan/data_laptop_script/master/mac
```

Then run it and start the installation:

```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

You will need to enter your computer password a few times throughout the script to allow installations.

At the end of the installation script, another script will run to attempt to check if any applications failed to install. (occasionally may claim some application are missing that aren't)

You can repeat this by running the following lines in terminal:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeclan/data_laptop_script/master/laptop_install_test
sh laptop_install_test
```
